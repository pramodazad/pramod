# htmlclean

* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) plugin: [grunt-htmlclean](https://github.com/anseki/grunt-htmlclean)
* [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) plugin: [gulp-htmlclean](https://github.com/anseki/gulp-htmlclean)

Simple and lightweight cleaner that just removes whitespaces, comments, etc. to minify HTML/SVG.  
This differs from others in that this removes whitespaces, line-breaks, etc. as much as possible.

## Removing
htmlclean removes the following texts.

+ The leading whitespaces, tabs and line-breaks, and the trailing whitespaces, tabs and line-breaks.
+ The unneeded whitespaces, tabs and line-breaks between HTML/SVG tags.
+ The more than two whitespaces, tabs and line-breaks (suppressed to one space).
+ HTML/SVG comments.

For example: The more than two whitespaces (even if those are divided by HTML/SVG tags) in a line are suppressed.

* Before

```html
<p>The <strong> clean <span> <em> HTML is here. </em> </span> </strong> </p>
```

* After

```html
<p>The <strong>clean <span><em>HTML is here.</em></span></strong></p>
```

The whitespace that was right side of `<strong>` was removed, and the left side was kept.  
The both side whitespaces of `<em>` were removed.

## Protecting

The following texts are protected (excluded from [Removing](#removing)).

+ The texts in `textarea`, `script` and `style` elements, and the text nodes in `pre` elements.
+ The quoted texts in the tag attributes.
+ The texts in the SSI tags (PHP, JSP, ASP/ASP.NET and Apache SSI).
+ IE conditional comments. e.g. `<!--[if lt IE 7]>`
+ The texts between `<!--[htmlclean-protect]-->` and `<!--[/htmlclean-protect]-->`.
+ The texts that is matched by the [`protect`](#protect) option.

## Installation

```shell
npm install -g htmlclean
```

## Command Line Tool

```shell
htmlclean [options] [input1 [input2 ...]]
```

Command line tool needs `-g` option when install package.  
See `htmlclean -h` for usage.

### Examples

* Clean `index.html`, and write to `index.min.html`.

```shell
htmlclean index.html
```

* Clean `index.html`, and overwrite it.

```shell
htmlclean index.html -o index.html
```

* Clean all HTML files in `src` directory, and write into `public` directory.

```shell
htmlclean src -o public
```

* Clean all SVG files.

```shell
htmlclean *.svg
```

* Get and clean web page on URL, and write to `index.html`.

```shell
wget -q -O - https://github.com/ | htmlclean -o index.html
```

* Clean and compress `index.html`, and write to `index.gz`.

```shell
htmlclean index.html -o - | gzip > index.gz
```

* Clean 3 files, and write into 1 file.

```shell
htmlclean -i head.html -i body.html -i foot.html \
-o index.html -o index.html -o index.html
```

### Drag & Drop & Clean

In the GUI environment, drag-and-drop the target file or directory or multiple items to the `htmlclean` icon. Or the short cut (alias, link, etc.) icon on the desktop also works.

The `htmlclean` icon is found in:

```shell
npm bin -g
```

## Node Module

```js
cleanHtml = htmlclean(sourceHtml[, options])
```

`require('htmlclean')` returns a Function. This Function accepts a source HTML, and returns a clean HTML. If you want, you can specify an `options` Object to second argument (see [Options](#options)).

```js
var htmlclean = require('htmlclean');
html = htmlclean(html);

// Or
html = require('htmlclean')(html);
```

### Options

You can specify an `options` Object to second argument. This Object can have following properties.

#### `protect`

Type: RegExp or Array

The texts which are matched to this RegExp are protected in addition to above [Protecting](#protecting) list. The multiple RegExps can be specified via an Array.

#### `unprotect`

Type: RegExp or Array

The texts which are matched to this RegExp are cleaned even if that text is included in above [Protecting](#protecting) list. The multiple RegExps can be specified via an Array.  
For example, a HTML as template in `<script type="text/x-handlebars-template">` is cleaned via following.

```js
html = htmlclean(html, {
  unprotect: /<script [^>]*\btype="text\/x-handlebars-template"[\s\S]+?<\/script>/ig
});
```

The `x-handlebars-template` in a `type` attribute above is case of using the Template Framework [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/). e.g. [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) requires `ng-template` instead of it.

*NOTE:* The RegExp has to match to a text which is not a part of the protected text. For example, the RegExp matches `color: red;` in `<style>` element, but this is not cleaned because all texts in the `<style>` element are protected. `color: red;` is a part of the protected text. The RegExp has to match to a text which is all of `<style>` element like `/<style[\s\S]+?<\/style>/`.

#### `edit`

Type: Function

This Function more edits a HTML.  
The protected texts are hidden from a HTML, and a HTML is passed to this Function. Therefore, this Function doesn't break the protected texts. A HTML which returned from this Function is restored.  
*NOTE:* The markers `\fID\f` (`\f` is "form feed" `\x0C` code, `ID` is number) are inserted to a HTML instead of the protected texts. This Function can remove these markers, but can't add new markers. (Invalid markers will be just removed.)

### Example

See the source HTML file and the result HTML files in the `sample` directory.

```js
var htmlclean = require('htmlclean'),
  fs = require('fs'),
  htmlBefore = fs.readFileSync('./before.html', {encoding: 'utf8'});

var htmlAfter1 = htmlclean(htmlBefore);
fs.writeFileSync('./after1.html', htmlAfter1);

var htmlAfter2 = htmlclean(htmlBefore, {
  protect: /<\!--%fooTemplate\b.*?%-->/g,
  unprotect: /<script [^>]*\btype="text\/x-handlebars-template"[\s\S]+?<\/script>/ig,
  edit: function(html) { return html.replace(/\begg(s?)\b/ig, 'omelet$1'); }
});
fs.writeFileSync('./after2.html', htmlAfter2);
```

## Note

### Malformed Nested Tags, and Close Tags in Script

htmlclean can't parse the malformed nested tags like `<p>foo<pre>bar</p>baz</pre>` precisely. And the close tags in script like `<script>var foo = '</script>';</script>` too. Or, `?>` in PHP code, etc.  
Some language parsers also mistake, then those recommend us to write code like `'<' + '/script>'`. This is better even if htmlclean is not used.

### SSI Tags in HTML Comments

htmlclean removes the HTML/SVG comments that include the SSI tag like `<!-- Info for admin - Foo:<?= expression ?> -->`. I think it's no problem because htmlclean is used to minify HTML. If that SSI tag includes the important code for logic, use a `protect` option, or `<!--[htmlclean-protect]-->` and `<!--[/htmlclean-protect]-->`.
